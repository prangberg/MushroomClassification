# MushroomClassification
HarvardX: PH125.9x Professional Certificate in Data Science - Choose Your Own Project

The goal of this project is to predict if mushrooms are edible or poisonous - based on their attributes. Since we want to avoid eating a poisonous mushroom, we strive for 100% accuracy.

We leverage linear regression and machine learning to find predictions that are as close to 100% accurate as possible.
